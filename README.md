* Start learning.

**Today's Progress**:

1. Started the challenge with this podcast - Bits, Binary, and Bytes by codenewbie.
2. Started learning Docker, learnt docker terminology, Setup a linux virtual box and get docker installed on it.
3. Learnt array rotation Problem from geeksforgeeks.

**Thoughts**:
    Its been a though day. Stuck during the installation process of docker in Ubuntu VM box. Still the issue exist, will try to fix it tomorrow. I very well achieved Day 1, will continue learning Docker and Array Problems.
