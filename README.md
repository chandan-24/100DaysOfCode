# My 100DayOfCode Challenge log
## Start: 14 March 2020

### Day 4: March 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:
* Practiced Some Array rotation and sorting problem from GeeksForGeeks.

**Thoughts**: 
    Nothing much. Have not much time for docker so just sloved some coding problem. From now on, will dedicate more time into this.

**Link(s) to work**:
* [Array algorithms which I practiced](https://github.com/chandan-24/coding-practice/tree/master/array)

**Resources**:
* [Array Algorithm - GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-data-structure/)

**Plan for Tomorrow**:
* Continue learning Docker and Array algorithms.

### Day 3: March 16, Monday

**Today's Progress**:
* Learnt an in depth concept of linux containers, which leads me to know about Control Groups, Namespaces, Containerisation and Virtualisation.

**Thoughts**: Whole day went exploring about containerazation. Started with exploring docker terminology but ends up clearing the concept about containerisation. The day went digging deeper & deeper into the concepts, Linux containers and then Cgroups & namespaces.s

**Resources**:
* Blog
- [A Beginner-Friendly Introduction to Containers, VMs and Docker](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-beginner-friendly-introduction-to-containers-vms-and-docker-79a9e3e119b/)
- [Learn Enough Docker to be Useful](https://towardsdatascience.com/learn-enough-docker-to-be-useful-b7ba70caeb4b)

* Video
- [What is a Container?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnJ7qX9fkcU)
- [Cgroups, namespaces, and beyond: what are containers made from?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK5i-N34im8&t=37s)s
- [Whats under the hood - Namespaces, Cgroups and OverlayFS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZdJ_3sBr6A)

**Plan for Tomorrow**:
* Continue learning Docker and Array algorithms.

### Day 2: March 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:
* Tried solving the installation issue of ubuntu in virtal box.
* Practiced Array algorithms from GeeksForGeeks.
* Continue learning Docker.

**Thoughts**: 
    Practiced some array algorithms from geeksforgeeks. Tried resolving docker installation issue, later came to know it can only be installed in 64-bit machine. Didn't able to figure out what causing the virtual box to not able to connect to internet, still unsolved.

**Plan for Tomorrow**:

### Day 1: March 14, Saturday

**Plans for Today**:
* Learn/Slove some Array algorithms from GeeksForGeeks.
* Start learning.

**Today's Progress**:
1. Started the challenge with this podcast - Bits, Binary, and Bytes by codenewbie.
2. Started learning Docker, learnt docker terminology, Setup a linux virtual box and get docker installed on it.
3. Learnt array rotation algorithm from geeksforgeeks.

**Thoughts**:
    Its been a though day. Stuck during the installation process of docker in Ubuntu VM box. Still the issue exist, will try to fix it tomorrow. I very well achieved Day 1, will continue learning Docker and Array algorithms.

**Plan for Tomorrow**:
* Continue learning Docker and Array algorithms.
