# My 100DayOfCode Challenge log
## Start: 14 March 2020

### Day 11: March 24, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:
* **Done nothing**

**Thoughts**:
    My bithday was on this day, not have enough time for the hands on as planned the day before but will do it 
    definitely the next day.

### Day 10: March 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**:
* Learned about docker-compose and various commands it offers.
* Learned to create and start various containers using docker-compose.

**Thoughts**:
    Since pasts 2 days I'm getting more comfortable with docker. Also was not able to do the hands on, tomorrow will set up the enviornment and host a webapp using docker-compose.

### Day 9: March 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:
* Written a simple nodejs web app to host it inside a container.
* written a Dockerfile that will host this webApp.

**Link to work**:
* [A containerised nodejs web app](https://github.com/chandan-24/learning-docker/tree/master/a-simple-web-app)

**Resources**:
* [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) used this platform to do the hands on.

### Day 8: March 21, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:
* Learned about Dockerfile and how to use it to create an image.
* Writen a Dockerfile to create a redis-server image and then created containers out of it.
* Writen a Dockerfile to create an image with nodeJs preinstalled and then created containers out of it.
* Docker Image is a FS snapshot of a container, created a image using this method also.

* [Dockerfile to create redis-server image](https://github.com/chandan-24/learning-docker/tree/master/create-redis-server-image)
* [Dockerfile to create an image with nodeJs preinstalled](https://github.com/chandan-24/learning-docker/tree/master/create-nodejs-image)

**Resources**:
* [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) used this platform to do the hands on.

### Day 7: March 20, Friday

**Today's Progress**:
* Today I launched few containers using Docker and executed some docker commands like RUN, CREATE, START, EXEC, STOP, KILL, PS etc.

**Thoughts**: 
    After 6 days of dig and reading, finally done some hands on #docker #containers. Excited for more learning.

**Link to work**:
* [Commands used to create and manage containers](https://github.com/chandan-24/learning-docker/blob/master/dockerCommands.sh)

**Resources**:
* [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) used this platform to do the hands on.

### Day 6: March 19, Thrusday

**Today's Progress**:
* Learned what is a Docker file and its different instructions like FROM, RUN, COPY etc. Also learned about how each instruction create a layer on top of prev. layer which are then combined by Union FileSystem - storage drivers of Docker-engine to form a container.

**Thoughts**: 
    Hhhhh, Learned much of the basic, from now on will dive into some hands-on.

### Day 5: March 18, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:
* Learned about Dockerfile, What are layers?,How containers are shipped from a Docker image, Volumes- persisting data in a container and some best practices of writing a Dockerfile. Also little bit about how your containers can be exploited.

**Thoughts**: 
    Watching the presentation from previous conference like DockerCon conference, helps in learning the basic idea behind evolution of some technology. These industry expert know what we people has no or poor understanding of. Watched to presentation today about containers(links below), learn new concepts and busted some common myth.

### Day 4: March 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:
* Practiced Some Array rotation and sorting problem from GeeksForGeeks.

**Thoughts**: 
    Nothing much. Have not much time for docker so just sloved some coding problem. From now on, will dedicate more time into this.

* [Array Problems which I practiced](https://github.com/chandan-24/coding-practice/tree/master/array)

**Resources**:

### Day 3: March 16, Monday

**Today's Progress**:
* Learnt an in depth concept of linux containers, which leads me to know about Control Groups, Namespaces, Containerisation and Virtualisation.

**Thoughts**: Whole day went exploring about containerazation. Started with exploring docker terminology but ends up clearing the concept about containerisation. The day went digging deeper & deeper into the concepts, Linux containers and then Cgroups & namespaces.s

**Resources**:
* Blog

### Day 2: March 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:
* Tried solving the installation issue of ubuntu in virtal box.
* Practiced Array Problems from GeeksForGeeks.
* Continue learning Docker.

**Thoughts**: 
    Practiced some array Problems from geeksforgeeks. Tried resolving docker installation issue, later came to know it can only be installed in 64-bit machine. Didn't able to figure out what causing the virtual box to not able to connect to internet, still unsolved.

### Day 1: March 14, Saturday

**Plans for Today**:
* Learn/Slove some Array Problems from GeeksForGeeks.
* Start learning.

**Today's Progress**:
1. Started the challenge with this podcast - Bits, Binary, and Bytes by codenewbie.
2. Started learning Docker, learnt docker terminology, Setup a linux virtual box and get docker installed on it.
3. Learnt array rotation Problem from geeksforgeeks.

**Thoughts**:
    Its been a though day. Stuck during the installation process of docker in Ubuntu VM box. Still the issue exist, will try to fix it tomorrow. I very well achieved Day 1, will continue learning Docker and Array Problems.
