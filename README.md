# My 100DayOfCode Challenge log
## Start: 14 March 2020

### Day 3: March 16, Monday

**Today's Progress**:
* Learnt an in deapth concept of linux containers, which leads me to know about Control Groups, Namespaces, Containerisation and Virtualisation.

**Thoughts**: Whole day went exploring about containerazation. Started with exploring docker terminology but ends up clearing the concept about containerisation. The day went digging deeper & deeper into the concepts, Linux containers and then Cgroups & namespaces.s

**Resources**:

**Plan for Tomorrow**:
* Continue learning Docker and Array algorithms.

### Day 2: March 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:
* Tried solving the installation issue of ubuntu in virtal box.
* Practiced Array algorithms from GeeksForGeeks.
* Continue learning Docker.

**Thoughts**: 
    Practiced some array algorithms from geeksforgeeks. Tried resolving docker installation issue, later came to know it can only be installed in 64-bit machine. Didn't able to figure out what causing the virtual box to not able to connect to internet, still unsolved.

**Plan for Tomorrow**:
* Continue learning Docker and Array algorithms.


### Day 1: March 14, Saturday

**Plans for Today**:
* Learn/Slove some Array algorithms from GeeksForGeeks.
* Start learning.

**Today's Progress**:
1. Started the challenge with this podcast - Bits, Binary, and Bytes by codenewbie.
2. Started learning Docker, learnt docker terminology, Setup a linux virtual box and get docker installed on it.
3. Learnt array rotation algorithm from geeksforgeeks.

**Thoughts**:
    Its been a though day. Stuck during the installation process of docker in Ubuntu VM box. Still the issue exist, will try to fix it tomorrow. I very well achieved Day 1, will continue learning Docker and Array algorithms.
